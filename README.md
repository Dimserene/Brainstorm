# About
Do you ever find yourself spending hours copying and renaming save files just to route a seeded run? **Yes!?** \n
Well say *hello* to **BRAINSTORM**, my easy-to-use save-state mod! \n
Brainstorm allows you to log up to **10** save-states at a time with just the press of a *(two)* button*(s)*!! \n
_"HURRAY!!!"_
Happy seed routing, my fellow academic weapons!!
